# AI_chatBot
A chat bot using CNN

It uses as input data sentences from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/metalwoz/ so the code works around this input format.

The bot tries to find the most similiar question between the user's input and it's data. Then he awnser's the user with the same awnser in it's data. 
It doesn't generate new awnsers :-(


## Have notice

If you want to work on this check the compatibility between the import libraries because the last version of each library wasn't compatable with each other.
